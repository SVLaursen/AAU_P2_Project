# AAU_P2_Project
Aalborg University, Medialogy 2nd Semester Project 
The goal of the project was to make an Android application for a certain target group, which in this case where type-2 diabetics. 
The application works by letting the user track their intake of medicine as well as how much time they've spent working out in the past week. The application also features a calendar which is currently using a "Wizard of Oz" technique to fake being connected to a database. 

## What I Learned
- How to create an Android application using Java
- How Android apps are structured
- How to use the built-in hardware on specific Android devices
